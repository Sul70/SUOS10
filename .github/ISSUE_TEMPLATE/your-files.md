If it has Passwords, Bank Accounts, Credit Card Numbers, or Sensitive Content, WE WILL NOT PUT IT IN. Upload to a Source, Like Google Drive or GitHub.
**Viruses**
If it is a Virus, We will put it into the VM Version of SUOS 10. (Coming Soon...)
**.bat, .vbs, .exe, and more.**
Those will be Scanned for Viruses, and if it is a virus, then we will... well... put it into the VM Version of SUOS 10. (Coming Soon...)
if not it will be put in "Code"
**Well, What if i get Hacked?**
